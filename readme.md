# Filter Performance Models

This repository holds all machine learning models developed for predicting and analyzing the performance of the industrial filtration system.

## Contents

- Trained model files (`.pkl`, `.json`, etc.)
- Model configurations, notes, and performance metrics
- Experiment versions and benchmarks (when available)

## Notes

While the aim is to document each model with relevant files and logs, uploads and organization may vary depending on priorities and available time.

## Purpose

To serve as a centralized space for storing and tracking the evolution of modeling work related to filter performance.
